To convert from a decimal to a binary is just as easy. Suppose we wanted to convert 43 in decimal to binary. At each step of the method we divide 43 by 2 and memorize the remainder. The final list of remainders is the required binary representation:

43/2 = 21 + remainder 1
21/2 = 10 + remainder 1
10/2 = 5  + remainder 0
5/2  = 2  + remainder 1
2/2  = 1  + remainder 0
1/2  = 0  + remainder 1
So 43 in decimal is 101011 in binary. By swapping all occurrences of 10 with b in our previous method we create a function which converts from a decimal number n to a number in base b (2<=b<=10):

public int fromDecimal(int n, int b)
{
   int result=0;
   int multiplier=1;
      
   while(n>0)
   {
      result+=n%b*multiplier;
      multiplier*=10;
      n/=b;
   }
      
   return result;
}
